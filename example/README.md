# Example - `solid-hcaptcha`

The demo routes are located in [`./src/demos/`](./src/demos/).

## Development

This example uses `pnpm` as the package manager.

To start the development server, run `pnpm dev`. If you need to build this example, run `pnpm build` and then `pnpm serve` to preview the build.

Before commiting, don't forget to `pnpm lint`.

When a new commit is made in the `example` folder, it will [automatically](../.github/workflows/deploy.yml) be deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://vexcited.github.io/solid-hcaptcha/).
